Bikeshare, short for "bike-sharing," is a transportation system that allows individuals to rent bicycles for short periods, typically for short trips or commutes within urban areas. It offers a convenient and flexible mode of transportation, often complementing public transit systems and providing an environmentally friendly and healthy alternative to cars for short-distance travel. 

The bikeshare system faces a dual challenge: optimizing fleet distribution throughout the day to align with fluctuating demand patterns and ensuring the safety and satisfaction of its customers. Efficient fleet distribution involves strategically allocating bikes to meet demand, enhancing operational efficiency and customer convenience. Concurrently, ensuring customer safety and satisfaction necessitates regular fleet maintenance to prevent malfunctions and accidents, requiring seamless scheduling to minimize customer disruption. The objective is to develop a predictive tool that accurately forecasts demand, allowing for optimal bike allocation to match demand dynamics, and facilitates efficient fleet maintenance scheduling to enhance safety and overall customer contentment within the bikeshare system.

7 model of meachine learning namely, linear regression, decision tree, KNN, gradient boosting, KBboost, catboost, and random forrest will be used and will be model benchmarked. The best model will going to be hyperparameter tuned hoping to get a better result.
